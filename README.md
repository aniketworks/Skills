This project was part my Google Data analytics Certification. At the time of course completion I used R for the analysis. Now that I learned Python and other related libraries, I again did new analysis. My goal was to figure out how Casual and Member riders used Cyclistic Platform differently. By observing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly trends I clearly logged my observations. Based on these observations I provided my suggestions for marketing strategy in 'Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis.pptx'
